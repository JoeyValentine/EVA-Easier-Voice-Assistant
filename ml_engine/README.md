# SpeakerRecognition_tutorial

A pytorch implementation of d-vector based speaker recognition system.  
All the features for training and testing are uploaded.  

## Requirements
python 3.5+  
pytorch 1.0.0  
pandas 0.23.4  
numpy 1.13.3  
pickle 4.0  
matplotlib 2.1.0  

## Datasets
We used the dataset collected through the following task.
- No. 10063424, 'development of distant speech recognition and multi-task dialog processing technologies for in-door conversational robots'

Specification
- Korean read speech corpus (ETRI read speech)
- Clean speech at a distance of 1m and a direction of 0 degrees
- 16kHz, 16bits  

We uploaded 40-dimensional log mel filterbank energy features extracted from the above dataset.  
[python_speech_features](https://github.com/jameslyons/python_speech_features) library is used.

### * Train
24000 utterances, 240 folders (240 speakers)  
Size : 3GB  
```feat_logfbank_nfilt40 - train```

### * Enroll & test
20 utterances, 10 folders (10 speakers)  
Size : 11MB  
```feat_logfbank_nfilt40 - test```

## Usage
### 1. Training  
Background model (ResNet based speaker classifier) is trained.  
You can change settings for training in 'train.py' file.

```python train.py```  

### 2. Enrollment  
Extract the speaker embeddings (d-vectors) using 10 enrollment speech files.  
They are extracted from the last hidden layer of the background model.  
All the embeddings are saved in 'enroll_embeddings' folder.  

```python enroll.py```  

### 3. Testing
For speaker verification,  you can change settings in 'verification.py' file.  

```python verification.py```  

For speaker identification,  you can change settings in 'identification.py' file.  

```python identification.py```
